To setup:

drop pygame-1.9.2------ into the main python directory

execute the following commands:
pip install wheel
pip install pygame-1.9.2------ 

Ofcourse the pygame name should be as on file so fill in as needed.
Will be updating the pygame to run off the latest python binaries so we
won't need to use wheel.
